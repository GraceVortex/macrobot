# Contributing Guidelines

This repository documents the complete development history of a systematic trading strategy. It is primarily an educational resource showing the evolution from exploration to production.

## Repository Purpose

**Educational:** Shows rigorous, scientific approach to strategy development
**Historical:** Preserves all phases of research and discoveries
**Practical:** Provides production-ready implementation

## Structure

- **Python files:** Complete development history (phase1.py through phase9.py)
- **outputs_phase*:** Results from each development phase
- **Documentation:** README.md and PROJECT_SUMMARY.md explain the journey

## Key Phases

- **Phase 3:** Signal generation (foundation)
- **Phase 8:** Initial improvements (idealized)
- **Phase 8.5:** Reality check (critical discovery)
- **Phase 9:** Final solution (production-ready)

## Using This Work

**For Learning:**
- Study the phase-by-phase evolution
- Understand why certain approaches failed
- Learn importance of realistic testing (OHLC vs clip)

**For Implementation:**
- Review `outputs_phase9/PRODUCTION_SPEC.txt`
- Read PROJECT_SUMMARY.md for context
- Use phase9.py as reference implementation

**For Research:**
- All intermediate phases preserved
- Data available in outputs_phase* folders
- Complete methodology documented

## Notes

- Strategy is production-ready but use at your own risk
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Proper risk management is essential
- Paper trade before live implementation
