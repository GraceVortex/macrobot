PHASE 10.8: VIX FILTER RESULTS
================================================================================

HYPOTHESIS: VIX filter (skip if VIX < 15) improves performance by avoiding calm periods

RESULT: ⚠️  MARGINAL (Score 1/3)
- Small positive effect on average (+0.06 Sharpe)
- Inconsistent across windows (4/9 improved, 5/9 worsened)
- DID help with worst case (2016-2017)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

VERDICT: ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED for production
(but keep as optional tool for extreme calm markets)

REASON:
- VIX filter DOES avoid the 2016-2017 disaster
- BUT also filters out some good trades
- Net effect: MARGINAL improvement

BETTER APPROACH:
→ Trade all CPI events by default
→ Use VIX < 12 (extreme calm) as warning flag
→ Or accept occasional bad years as part of strategy

================================================================================
WHY MARGINAL RESULTS?
================================================================================

PROBLEM: VIX filter is TOO CRUDE

1. GOOD: Avoided 2016-2017 disaster
   - Worst window -0.78 → -0.21 (improvement!)
   - Skipped 19/24 low-VIX events

2. BAD: Also skipped profitable low-VIX trades
   - 2018-2019 window got WORSE (1.25 → 0.52)
   - Some low-VIX days still had good CPI surprises

3. MIXED: Inconsistent across periods
   - Sometimes helps, sometimes hurts
   - VIX < 15 is not a perfect regime indicator

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE FILTERS TO CONSIDER
================================================================================

Instead of simple VIX threshold, consider:

OPTION 1: Extreme VIX filter (VIX < 12)
- Less aggressive
- Only skip truly dead markets
- Keep more trades

OPTION 2: CPI Volatility filter
recent_cpi_vol = std(last 6 CPI surprises)
IF recent_cpi_vol < 0.2:
    SKIP (CPI data not volatile)

OPTION 3: Combo filter
IF VIX < 12 AND recent_cpi_vol < 0.2:
    SKIP (both calm)
ELSE:
    TRADE

OPTION 4: No filter, accept bad years
- Trade all CPI events
- 2016-2017 was only 1 bad period in 15 years
- Long-term still profitable (8/9 windows)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

PRODUCTION CONFIG: NO VIX FILTER

Reasons:
1. Marginal improvement (+0.06 Sharpe) not worth complexity
2. Filters out 40% of trades (reduces frequency)
3. Inconsistent - sometimes hurts more than helps
4. 2016-2017 was rare (1/9 windows)

OPTIONAL: Use VIX as WARNING (not filter)
- If VIX < 12 on CPI day → reduce position size 50%
- Don't skip trade completely
- Keeps exposure but hedges risk

PAPER TRADING PLAN:
→ Trade ALL CPI events (no filter)
→ Track VIX on each trade day
→ After 10 trades, evaluate:
   - If most low-VIX trades lose → reconsider filter
   - If low-VIX trades mixed → keep no filter

================================================================================
COMPARISON TO PHASE 10.7 (UNFILTERED)
================================================================================

Phase 10.7 (no filter):
- Mean test Sharpe: 0.62
- Median test Sharpe: 0.67
- Positive windows: 8/9 (88.9%)
- Trade frequency: 100%

Phase 10.8 (VIX filter):
- Mean test Sharpe: 0.68 (filtered only)
- Improvement: +0.06 over unfiltered
- Positive windows: 7/9 (77.8%)
- Trade frequency: 60.5%

TRADE-OFF:
- Slightly better Sharpe (+0.06)
- BUT 40% fewer trades
- AND less consistent (7/9 vs 8/9)

VERDICT: Not worth the trade-off

================================================================================
FINAL DECISION
================================================================================

✅ KEEP Phase 10.7 config (NO VIX FILTER)

Conservative setup:
- CPI only
- 5-day hold
- OHLC 3% stop
- NO VIX filter
- Accept occasional bad years (like 2016-2017)

Expected:
- Sharpe: 0.5-0.7 (includes bad periods)
- Win rate: 40-50%
- Frequency: ~12 trades/year
- 1-2 bad years per decade

Status: READY FOR PAPER TRADING (no VIX filter needed)
