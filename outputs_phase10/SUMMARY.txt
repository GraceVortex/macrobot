================================================================================
PHASE 10: MULTI-EVENT MACRO STRATEGY - SUMMARY
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Test TMF trading on economic event surprises (NFP, CPI, PMI, Retail, PCE)
Using Phase 9 best practices: OHLC stops, scaled costs, systematic testing

DATA:
- TMF OHLC: 2018-2024
- Economic Events: 266 events (NFP, CPI, Core_PCE, ISM_PMI, Retail_Sales)
- Period: 2020-2024 (main activity)

STRATEGY:
surprise = actual - consensus
IF surprise > threshold: SHORT TMF (hawkish)
IF surprise < -threshold: LONG TMF (dovish)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. STOPS WORK FOR EVENT STRATEGY (opposite of Phase 9!)
--------------------------------------------------------
No stop:       Sharpe 0.13   Total +18%   Win 55.2%
OHLC stop 2%:  Sharpe 1.32   Total +155%  Win 48.5%  <- BEST
OHLC stop 3%:  Sharpe 0.97   Total +118%  Win 51.5%
OHLC stop 5%:  Sharpe 0.58   Total +75%   Win 54.6%

WHY STOPS WORK HERE:
- Events cause directional moves (trend, not noise)
- Stop protects from wrong direction calls
- Unlike Phase 9 (correlation signals), events create clear momentum

2. ISM_PMI = BEST EVENT TYPE
-----------------------------
ISM_PMI:       Sharpe 9.87   Win 100%   (6 trades)   <- INCREDIBLE
CPI:           Sharpe 1.02   Win 59.5%  (42 trades)  <- GOOD
Core_PCE:      Sharpe -0.27  Win 57.1%  (14 trades)
NFP:           Sharpe -0.19  Win 55.6%  (45 trades)  <- DOESN'T WORK
Retail_Sales:  Sharpe -0.54  Win 46.4%  (56 trades)  <- AVOID

RECOMMENDATION: Focus on ISM_PMI + CPI only

3. HOLDING PERIOD: 5-DAY BEST
------------------------------
1-day hold:  Sharpe 0.42   Total +44%   Win 52.1%
2-day hold:  Sharpe 0.13   Total +18%   Win 55.2%
5-day hold:  Sharpe 0.63   Total +111%  Win 51.5%  <- BEST

Event impact takes time to fully play out

4. THRESHOLD SENSITIVITY
------------------------
Baseline (default):    Sharpe 0.13   163 trades
Tight (50% default):   Sharpe 0.12   182 trades  (more trades, similar Sharpe)
Wide (150% default):   Sharpe -0.00  159 trades  (fewer trades, zero return)

Default thresholds work reasonably well

================================================================================
OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

Based on Block tests:

BEST OVERALL:
- Events: ISM_PMI + CPI only
- Stop: OHLC 2%
- Holding: 5 days
- Expected Sharpe: ~2.0+ (combining ISM + CPI with stops)

CONSERVATIVE:
- Events: CPI only (more frequent, stable)
- Stop: OHLC 3%
- Holding: 5 days
- Expected Sharpe: ~1.0

COMPARISON TO PHASE 9

                        (Correlation)       (Events)
Strategy:               TLT correlation     Economic surprises
Best Stop:              NONE                OHLC 2%
Best Sharpe:            0.92                1.32

                        (stops hurt)        (stops help)

KEY INSIGHT:
Stop-loss effectiveness depends on signal type:
- Correlation signals: noisy, stops harmful
- Event surprises: directional, stops beneficial

================================================================================
PRODUCTION RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

STRATEGY: ISM_PMI + CPI Event Trading

CONFIGURATION:
- Entry: ISM_PMI or CPI surprise > threshold
- Direction: Positive surprise → SHORT TMF, Negative → LONG
- Entry price: Market open next trading day
- Stop-loss: OHLC 2% (CRITICAL!)
- Holding: 5 business days
- Exit: Close price at T+5 or stop hit

THRESHOLDS:
- ISM_PMI: |surprise| > 2.0 points
- CPI: |surprise_pct| > 0.1%

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE (Conservative, 30% haircut):
- Sharpe: 0.7-0.9 (backtest: ~1.0-1.3)
- Win Rate: 50-55%
- Avg Return: +0.5-0.7% per trade
- Frequency: ~3-4 trades/month (ISM + CPI)
- Max DD: -20-30%

TRANSACTION COSTS:
- Base: 0.15% * 2 (entry + exit) = 0.30%
- Already included in backtest

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Max 1 position at a time
- Skip event if VIX > 50 (extreme volatility)
- Review strategy quarterly
- Stop trading after 3 consecutive losses

================================================================================
LIMITATIONS & RISKS
================================================================================

1. SMALL SAMPLE FOR ISM_PMI
   - Only 6 trades in backtest
   - 100% win rate likely not sustainable
   - Conservative estimate: 60-70% win rate

2. EVENT DATA QUALITY
   - Manual data collection (266 events)
   - Possible errors in actual/consensus values
   - Need automated data feed for live trading

3. REGIME DEPENDENCY
   - Tested mainly 2020-2024 (volatile period)
   - May underperform in calm markets
   - Need longer history validation

4. EXECUTION RISK
   - Events at 8:30 AM ET
   - Market open 9:30 AM ET
   - 1-hour gap can cause slippage

5. STOP EXECUTION
   - 2% stop is tight for 3x leveraged TMF
   - Intraday volatility can trigger stops
   - Need real-time monitoring

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. IMMEDIATE:
   - Validate ISM_PMI results (too good to be true?)
   - Check for data errors in events CSV
   - Test on longer history (2015-2019)

2. SHORT TERM:
   - Set up automated event data feed
   - Paper trade for 2-3 months
   - Refine thresholds based on recent data

3. MEDIUM TERM:
   - Add Core CPI if backtests improve
   - Test other PMI types (Services PMI)
   - Consider combining with Phase 9 correlation strategy

4. VALIDATION:
   - Walk-forward test: train 2020-2022, test 2023-2024
   - Stress test: only use 2022 (high vol year)
   - Conservative test: remove ISM_PMI outlier

================================================================================
DECISION
================================================================================

VERDICT: PROMISING but needs validation

STRENGTHS:
+ OHLC 2% stop works incredibly well (Sharpe 1.32)
+ ISM_PMI + CPI show strong results
+ 5-day hold captures full event impact
+ Clear entry/exit rules

CONCERNS:
- ISM_PMI sample too small (6 trades)
- NFP and Retail don't work (need to avoid)
- 2% stop might be too tight for live
- Event data quality needs verification

RECOMMENDATION:
1. Focus on CPI only first (Sharpe 1.02, 42 trades)
2. Use OHLC 3% stop (more conservative than 2%)
3. 5-day holding period
4. Paper trade 2-3 months before live
5. Add ISM_PMI only after validating results

CONSERVATIVE EXPECTED (CPI only, 3% stop, 5-day):
- Sharpe: 0.7-0.8
- Annual return: 10-15%
- Max DD: -25-30%
- Trades: ~12-15 per year

If live results match backtest, this could be combined with Phase 9
for portfolio diversification.

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Phase 10 demonstrates that:

1. Economic event strategies CAN work (unlike common wisdom)
2. Stop-loss is CRITICAL for event trading (opposite of Phase 9)
3. Event selection matters (ISM/CPI good, NFP/Retail bad)
4. Longer holds (5-day) capture full impact

Key learning: Stop-loss effectiveness depends on signal type
- Noise-based signals (Phase 9): stops hurt
- Event-based signals (Phase 10): stops help

Combined with Phase 9, creates diversified macro strategy:
- Phase 9: High-frequency correlation (3-4 trades/year)
- Phase 10: Event-driven (12-15 trades/year)
- Total: ~20 trades/year with different alpha sources

Status: PROMISING - proceed to validation phase
